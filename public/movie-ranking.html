<h1>The Best Movies according to Yajat</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>One of the greatest movie ever made. The message of Hope is well passed to the watcher. "Get busy living or get busy dying" - this quote sums 
    up the crux of the entire movie. A watcher can see himself in Andy Dufresne and learn from him as the movie progresses, the power of hope. Hope can 
    give you wings, it can set you free.

<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>This movie makes you feel like you were present at the night when the Atlantic took the lives of hundreds of persons
, their dreams vanquished like a matchstick in the rain. The iceberg killed the soul of a hundred people and destroyed lives twice as manu.
Jack and Rose's story is beatiful in every regard as it tears the waatchers heart in pieces towards the end.
"Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure playing with you tonight!"
</p>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<P>Do you know the difference between a Quarter Pounder with Cheese and the Royale with Cheese?
    <br>
    No, then you should. Pulp Fiction is a movie that one should watch to enjoy the sheer emotions that you feel as each of it's part
    completes. Entertaining in every regard, it should be a pipe dream for every avid movie watcher.
